### About the Experiment 
Definition of V-I Characteristics of SCR: -
A V-I Characteristic of SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier) is the voltage current characteristics.
The current through the SCR varies as the Anode to Cathode terminal
voltage and Gate to Cathode terminal voltage is varied.
The graphical representation of current through the SCR and voltage across the anode to
cathode terminal is known as V-I Characteristics of SCR.
